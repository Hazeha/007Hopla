	<h1> Activity</h1>
		
	<p>Strenght and flexibility is necessary to perform twists and lifts as well as rhythm and flair to synchronise and interpret the music, which they listen to through underwater speakers.  </p>
		
		<h2> Our coaches</h2>
		
	<p>We hire the best coaches to make sure every customer (both amateur and professional) will have the full benefits of synchronised swimming. They will prepare an intense workout regime + recreational activities for the professional teams. The amateur team will have a similar workout plan, with not as much intensity as the professional one. If one of the amateur customers has potential to go professional, we will add him/her to the professional teams.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Professional</h2>
		
	
<p>There are two trainings a day one in the morning and one in the afternoon, 5-6 times a week, but it can change considering how many categories you are joining. (solo/duo/formation). We also provide ice bath and sauna for the recovery after sessions.
Join us and be part of an incredible team which will make your dreams come true.
</p>

		<h2>Amateur</h2>
	
<p>The majority of people think that synchro swimming is just for the younger ages who want to compete  with each other and wear those beautiful sparkly dresses. But besides  these details this sport has so many different benefits to our body, that is why we dedicated to train amatuer athletes in all ages. We believe that with the help of synchro swimming people can show their artistic skills while staying fit
